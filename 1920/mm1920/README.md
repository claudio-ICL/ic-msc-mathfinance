This directory stores the computational exercises 
that I prepared for 
the module *Market Microstructure* offered within the [__MSc Mathematics and Finance__](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/mathematics/mathematics-finance/) 
at Imperial College London in the academic year 2019-2020. 
The module leader is [Prof. Johannes Muhle-Karbe](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.muhle-karbe). 
The main reference is Foucault, Thierry, Pagano, Marco, and Roell, Ailsa. Market Liquidity : Theory, Evidence, and Policy. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2013.

Please send comments and suggestions to c.bellani17@imperial.ac.uk so that we can improve the material for future cohorts!
