These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a $1.00 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call-option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.},

An agent assumes this volatility to be a specific function of time and the stock price, knowing that this assumption may result in a misspecification of the volatility. However, if the misspecified volatility dominates the true volatility, then the misspecified price of the option dominates its true price. Moreover, the option hedging strategy computed under the assumption of the misspecified volatility provides an almost sure one‐sided hedge for the option under the true volatility. Analogous results hold if the true volatility dominates the misspecified volatility. These comparisons can fail, however, if the misspecified volatility is not assumed to be a function of time and the stock price. The positive results, which apply to both European and American options, are used to obtain a bound and hedge for Asian options.",

Denote by $G_T(\Theta )$ the space of all random variables $(\theta \cdot X)_T$ , where $\theta $ is a predictable $X$ -integrable process such that the stochastic integral $\theta \cdot X$ is in the space ${\cal S} ^2$ of semimartingales. We investigate under which conditions on the semimartingale $X$ the space $G_T(\Theta )$ is closed in ${\cal L} ^2(\Omega , {\cal F} ,P)$ , a question which arises naturally in the applications to financial mathematics. Our main results give necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the closedness of $G_T(\Theta )$ in ${\cal L} ^2(P)$ . Most of these conditions deal with BMO -martingales and reverse Hölder inequalities which are equivalent to weighted norm inequalities. By means of these last inequalities, we also extend previous results on the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition.",

	journal={Bell Journal of Economics},

	pages={141-183},
	abstract={The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.},

We consider an idealized financial security with continuous price paths, without making any stochastic assumptions. It is shown that typical price paths possess quadratic variation, where “typical” is understood in the following game-theoretic sense: there exists a trading strategy that earns infinite capital without risking more than one monetary unit if the process of quadratic variation does not exist. Replacing time by the quadratic variation process, we show that the price path becomes Brownian motion. This is essentially the same conclusion as in the Dubins–Schwarz result, except that the probabilities (constituting the Wiener measure) emerge instead of being postulated. We also give an elegant statement, inspired by Peter McCullagh’s unpublished work, of this result in terms of game-theoretic probability theory.},

	abstract={Given a Gaussian process $X$, its canonical geometric rough path lift $\mathbf{X}$, and a solution $Y$ to the rough differential equation $\mathrm{d}Y{t} = V\left (Y_{t}\right ) \circ \mathrm{d} \mathbf{X}_t$, we present a closed-form correction formula for $\int Y_t \circ \mathrm{d} \mathbf{X}_t - \int Y_t \, \mathrm{d} X_t$, i.e. the difference between the rough and Skorohod integrals of $Y$ with respect to $X$. When $X$ is standard Brownian motion, we recover the classical Stratonovich-to-It{\o} conversion formula, which we generalize to Gaussian rough paths with finite $p$-variation for $1 \leq p < 3$, and Volterra Gaussian rough paths for $3 \leq p < 4$. This encompasses many familiar examples, including fractional Brownian motion with $H > \frac{1}{4}$. It\{o}'s formula can also be recovered in the case when $Y_t = \nabla f( X_t)$ for some smooth $f$. \par To prove the formula, we show that $\int Y_t \, \mathrm{d} X_t$ is the $L2(\Omega)$ limit of its Riemann-sum approximants, and that the approximants can be appended with a suitable compensation term without altering the limit. To show convergence of the Riemann-sum approximants, we utilize a novel characterization of the Cameron-Martin norm using multi-dimensional Young-Stieltjes integrals. For the main theorem, complementary regularity between the Cameron-Martin paths and the covariance function of $X$ is used to show the existence of these integrals. However, it turns out not to be a necessary condition, as we provide a new set of conditions for their existence, as well as provide a new formulation of the classical It\{o}-Skorohod isometry in terms of these Young-Stieltjes integrals.},

	abstract={In many applications, it is important to be able to sample paths of SDEs conditional on observations of various kinds. This paper studies SPDEs which solve such sampling problems. The SPDE may be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Langevin equation used in finite-dimensional sampling. In this paper, conditioned nonlinear SDEs, leading to nonlinear SPDEs for the sampling, are studied. In addition, a class of preconditioned SPDEs is studied, found by applying a Green's operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant measure remains unchanged; such infinite dimensional evolution equations are important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite dimensional problems. The resulting SPDEs provide several significant challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired sampling in the nonlinear case, via a change of measure.},

A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.},

	abstract={In this paper we study dynamic backward problems, with the computation of conditional expectations as a main objective, in a framework where the (forward) state process satisfies a Volterra type SDE, with fractional Brownian motion as a typical example. Such processes are neither Markov processes nor semimartingales, and most notably, they feature a certain time inconsistency which makes any direct application of Markovian ideas, such as flow properties, impossible without passing to a path-dependent framework. Our main result is a functional It\^{o} formula, extending the seminal work of Dupire \cite{Dupire} to our more general framework. In particular, unlike in \cite{Dupire} where one needs only to consider the stopped paths, here we need to concatenate the observed path up to the current time with a certain smooth observable curve derived from the distribution of the future paths. This new feature is due to the time inconsistency involved in this paper. We then derive the path dependent PDEs for the backward problems.

	abstract={We present a theory of hypoellipticity and unique ergodicity for semilinear parabolic stochastic PDEs with "polynomial" nonlinearities and additive noise, considered as abstract evolution equations in some Hilbert space. It is shown that if Hörmander's bracket condition holds at every point of this Hilbert space, then a lower bound on the Malliavin covariance operatorμt can be obtained. Informally, this bound can be read as "Fix any finite-dimensional projection on a subspace of sufficiently regular functions. Then the eigenfunctions of μt with small eigenvalues have only a very small component in the image of Π." We also show how to use a priori bounds on the solutions to the equation to obtain good control on the dependency of the bounds on the Malliavin matrix on the initial condition. These bounds are sufficient in many cases to obtain the asymptotic strong Feller property introduced in [HM06]. One of the main novel technical tools is an almost sure bound from below on the size of "Wiener polynomials," where the coefficients are possibly non-adapted stochastic processes satisfying a Lips chitz condition. By exploiting the polynomial structure of the equations, this result can be used to replace Norris' lemma, which is unavailable in the present context. We conclude by showing that the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and a large class of reaction-diffusion equations fit the framework of our theory.},

We revisit and extend some recent ground-breaking work of Cass-Litterer-Lyons in this regard; as by-product, we obtain a user-friendly "transitivity property" of such integrability estimates. We also consider rough integrals; as a novel application, uniform Weibull tail estimates for a class of (random) rough integrals are obtained. A concrete example arises from the stochastic heat-equation, spatially mollified by hyper-viscosity, and we can recover (in fact: sharpen) a technical key result of [Hairer, Comm.PureAppl.Math.64,no.11,(2011),1547-1585].},

Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a naive approach based on this underlying principle. In finite dimensions, it is well known that cubature can be a very effective approach to integration. We discuss the appropriate extension of this idea to {Wiener} space. In the process we develop high–order numerical schemes valid for high–dimensional SDEs and semi–elliptic PDEs.},

	abstract={This paper introduces in detail a new systematic method to construct approximate finite-dimensional solutions for the nonlinear filtering problem. Once a finite-dimensional family is selected, the nonlinear filtering equation is projected in Fisher metric on the corresponding manifold of densities, yielding the projection filter for the chosen family. The general definition of the projection filter is given, and its structure is explored in detail for exponential families. Particular exponential families which optimize the correction step in the case of discrete-time observations are given, and an a posteriori estimate of the local error resulting from the projection is defined. Simulation results comparing the projection filter and the optimal filter for the cubic sensor problem are presented. The classical concept of assumed density filter (ADF) is compared with the projection filter. It is shown that the concept of ADF is inconsistent in the sense that the resulting filters depend on the choice of a stochastic calculus, i.e. the {It\^{o}} or the Stratonovich calculus. It is shown that in the context of exponential families, the projection filter coincides with the Stratonovich-based ADF. An example is provided, which shows that this does not hold in general, for non-exponential families of densities.},

	abstract={  (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae and/or non-USASCII text omitted; see image) We examine some differential geometric approaches to finding approximate solutions to the continuous time nonlinear filtering problem. Our primary focus is a new projection method for the optimal filter infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), based on the direct ... metric and on a family of normal mixtures. This results in a new finite-dimensional approximate filter based on the differential geometric approach to statistics. We compare this new filter to earlier projection methods based on the Hellinger distance/Fisher metric and exponential families, and compare the ... mixture projection filter with a particle method with the same number of parameters, using the Levy metric. We discuss differences between projecting the SPDE for the normalized density, known as Kushner-Stratonovich equation, and the SPDE for the unnormalized density known as Zakai equation. We prove that for a simple choice of the mixture manifold the ... mixture projection filter coincides with a Galerkin method, whereas for more general mixture manifolds the equivalence does not hold and the ... mixture filter is more general. We study particular systems that may illustrate the advantages of this new filter over other algorithms when comparing outputs with the optimal filter. We finally consider a specific software design that is suited for a numerically efficient implementation of this filter and provide numerical examples. We leverage an algebraic ring structure by proving that in presence of a given structure in the system coefficients the key integrations needed to implement the new filter equations can be executed offline.},
